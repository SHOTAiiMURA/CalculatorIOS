# Calculator App

## Requirement

## External Library
-Qtdesigner
## Introduction
  I have created a calculator application influenced by the design installed in the default application of the Iphone. This calculator application can perform basic four arithmetic operations.
## Launch
Developers have to install Pycharm in order to launch application. You install pyqt5 on your Pycharm environment. 
1. Download project file from GitHub repository
2. Fork project, and then import project from CSV.
3. Run Calculator IOS from main.pyw
## Key Design Idea
1. Main UI

2. The color changes when the cursor is moved over the button.
3. The numbers previously typed were displayed above the numbers shown on the main display.
