## Requirement
-Python 3
## External Library
-Qtdesigner
## Introduction
  I have created a calculator application influenced by the design installed in the default application of the Iphone. This calculator application can perform basic four arithmetic operations.
## Launch
Developers have to install Pycharm in order to launch application. You install pyqt5 on your Pycharm environment. 
1. Download project file from GitHub repository
2. Fork project, and then import project from CSV.
3. Run Calculator IOS from main.pyw
## Key Design Idea
1. Main UI

2. The color changes when the cursor is moved over the button.

3. The numbers previously typed were displayed above the numbers shown on the main display.

## Key Programming Idea
- avoiding infinite number
- When the calculation is finished and the next number is entered, the previous number is automatically deleted.

## Future Improvement
  This was my first time using GUI and Python to create an application. I created the calculator in a few hours. This time I implemented only simple four math functions. In my next project, I would like to implement a calculator that can perform calculations, adding root calculations and statistical calculations to the calculator. Also, I would like to add a split function, which is not available in the iPhone calculator, and a tip calculation function, which would be useful when traveling abroad.
## Impression
  When I wrote the Python code, I wrote it using conditional processing. Since it was only a function of basic computation, it was not difficult to write codes. However, there was one problem that took me some time to solve: when I input a decimal point, the number was displayed on the console, but not on the calculator display. In conclusion, this project made me realize how great and fun the GUI is and inspired me to create more projects using it.
